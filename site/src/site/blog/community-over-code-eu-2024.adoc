:description: This post looks at the ASF Community Over Code EU conference in Bratislava, Slovakia, June 3-5 2024, with a particular focus on the Groovy Track.
:keywords: groovy, asf, apachecon, communityovercode

This year's European edition of the ASF conference, https://eu.communityovercode.org[Community Over Code EU],
featured three in-person days of sessions (June 3-5) in Bratislava, Slovakia, including a Groovy track on the last day.

NOTE: The presentation slides and audio/video (where available) are still being added onto the conference site.
If additional material becomes available, this post will be updated with links to the additional content.

This post gives a short trip report on the conference mostly focussed on the Groovy track.

== The Conference, Venue, and Host city

The conference was hosted at the Radisson Blu Carlton in Bratislava, Slovakia. The facilities were great,
and it was a great city to visit.

Kudos to all involved for making the event a fruitful and rewarding one!

== Highlights from the Groovy BoF and Groovy Track

We had a very engaging Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session with various users of the
Groovy programming language including a large contingent from the https://ofbiz.apache.org/[Apache OFBiz]
project. We also discussed some of the reasons why Groovy is still a compelling
language choice in 2024.

=== Why use Groovy in 2024?

This talk looked at some of the compelling reasons for using Groovy today.

https://speakerdeck.com/paulk/groovy-today[Why use Groovy in 2024?]

Some highlights:

* Groovy's 80+ AST transforms allow you to write concise declarative style code.
As one example, here's an example of a deeply immutable `Book` class with
additional generated code for comparators (sorting), custom serialization and deserialization,
and some special JavaBean index handling code:
+
image:img/coceu2024_transforms.png[AST transform example]
* Groovy's 2000+ extension methods enrich the Java class libraries with additional
functionality. As one example, primitive array extensions speed up certain operations
where you might otherwise use streams:
+

* Groovy's operator overloading and extensible tooling greatly simplifies
use of the libraries and APIs that Java programmers are familiar with.
Here's an example of using Apache Commons Math:
+
image:img/coceu2024_operator_overloading.png[matrix example]
* Groovy has excellent scripting and domain specific language (DSL) support. As one example,
in about 10 lines of code, you can write a statically-typed DSL for working with Roman
numerals. Once the DSL is defined, you can use it in scripts like this:
+
[source,groovy]
----
assert [LVII + LVII, V * III, V ** II, IV..(V+I), [X, V, I].sort()]
    == [       cxiv,      xv,     xxv,    iv..vi, [i, v, x]       ]
----
+
Invalid roman numerals are detected at compile-time:

=== Classifying Iris flowers with Groovy, Deep Learning, and GraalVM

This talk looked at the machine language problem of classification using a classic Iris flowers dataset.

https://speakerdeck.com/paulk/groovy-iris[Classifying Iris flowers with Groovy, Deep Learning, and GraalVM]

Highlights:

* Classification predicts the class of something using models trained
on measured features given a known class:
+
image:img/coceu2024_iris1.png[classifiation,width=80%]

* The case study uses a well-known Iris dataset.
The measured features are sepal width and length, and petal width and length:
+
image:img/coceu2024_iris2.png[classifiation,width=80%]

* First, a number of classic algorithms for doing classification were examined
including the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm, here using the Weka data science library:
+
image:img/coceu2024_iris3.png[classifiation,width=80%]

* Then neural networks are explained. A potential network for the case study
is shown here:
+
image:img/coceu2024_iris4.png[classifiation,width=80%]

* Each node acts like a neuron in the human brain:
image:img/coceu2024_iris5.png[classifiation,width=80%]

* Several libraries for deep learning were discussed including Deep Netts:
+
image:img/coceu2024_iris6.png[classifiation,width=80%]

* Compiling the script using the Groovy compiler with the `--compile-static` switch and
then using GraalVM to build a native image gave a more than 10 times speed increase:

=== Getting Started with the Micronaut Framework

https://sergiodelamo.com/[Sergio del Amo] gave a talk on
https://speakerdeck.com/sdelamo/getting-started-with-the-micronaut-framework[Getting Started with the Micronaut Framework], in particular
its support for using Groovy when building microservices.
https://speakerdeck.com/sdelamo/getting-started-with-the-micronaut-framework[image:img/coceu2024_micronaut.png[slide deck first slide]]

Highlights:

* The speed of Micronaut applications comes from its ahead-of-time approach:
+

=== Whiskey Clustering with Apache Projects:Groovy, Commons CSV, Commons Math, Ignite, Spark, Wayang, Beam, and Flink

This talk looked at the machine language problem of clustering using a well-known whiskey flavor profiles dataset.

https://speakerdeck.com/paulk/groovy-whiskey[Whiskey Clustering with Apache Projects:Groovy, Commons CSV, Commons Math, Ignite, Spark, Wayang, Beam, &amp; Flink]

Highlights:

* The case study looked at how to cluster 86 single malt scotch whiskies based on rankings of 12 flavor categories:
+
image:img/Clustering0.png[Whiskey flavour profiles]

* There are different algorithms that can be used to do the clustering.
K-Means clustering was the key algorithm covered:
+
image:img/Clustering1.png[The k-means algorithm]

* The talk covers using vanilla data science libraries
including Apache Commons Math to solve this problem, then looks at
how you might scale up the problem using a range of Apache technologies.
The first technology considered was Apache Ignite. First we read in the data:
+
image:img/Clustering2.png[Whiskey flavour profiles]

* Then we use Ignite's distributed clustering libraries to find the centroids:
+
image:img/Clustering3.png[Whiskey flavour profiles]

* Various options to tweak the algorithm and various
ways to visualize the results were examined:
+
image:img/Clustering4.png[Whiskey flavour profiles with Ignite]

* The same case study was also done using Spark:
+
image:img/coceu2024_whiskey1.png[Whiskey flavour profiles with Apache Spark]

* The same case study was also done using Apache Wayang:
+
image:img/coceu2024_whiskey2.png[Whiskey flavour profiles with Wayang]

* The same case study was also done using Apache Beam (Python-style version shown here):
+

== Posters

Community over Code EU also featured a dedicated area for poster sessions.
Corridor conversations are a key part of any ASF conference.
The posters provided a complimentary way to trigger conversations
as well as to learn about a range of topics if the folks who might know
all about those topics aren't in the corridor at the same time as you.
